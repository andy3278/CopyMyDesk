Q9Qu-ddjDEE,Software Engineer&#39;s Productive and Minimal Desk Setup (2023),Brian Ruiz,2023-10-04 04:47:01,hello and welcome back to the channel today I will be sharing my workspace which I've optimized to get work done as a software engineer and part-time Creator and overall just excited to share some of the gear I use which surprisingly a lot of people have asked me about in the comments overall I try to keep my setup rather simple as with many things Simplicity and efficiency are key aspects for me and how I work I feel like keeping a minimal and clutter-free space is what works best for me helps me stay stress free and enable with my productivity and creativity you can find all my gear and tools on my website at b-r dot IO slash cure or just check out the description by the way I'm testing my brand new dream camera this is the Sony fx3 still pretty much learning how to use it let me know if you think it looks good so let's jump into it and I'm going to start with one of the most important components and conveniently the sponsor of today's video you know as a software engineer you have to consider that you're going to be spending long hours at your desk for me I spent about 12 hours and if there's one thing I've learned during these Marathon sessions it's the importance of good ergonomics that's why I've always used standing desk ergonomic mice and have this ergonomic monitor but besides that it was time for an upgrade for my old Ikea particle forecast which was well let's just say not holding up anymore that's when ergonoff is thankfully stepped in and sent me their incredible sit stand the sway desk along with a few other cool products that I'll be sharing so let's talk about suede death it's packed with features that anyone who values good design and simplicity will appreciate it it has two safe positions per user so whether I'm sitting for a long Kodi session or standing to edit some videos is just an intuitive swipe away and let's not forget about the beautiful solid wood surface it's responsibly sourced and comes pre-drilled standout feature for me is the anti-collision system it's happened to me when I have people over and one time they accidentally lowered the desk with my chair under it and the entire desk just smushes anything that's under it so ergonoff has actually thought about this and programmed it also they sent over this super nice solid wood on a riser which is a known ergonomic thing it's recommended for the top of the monitor to be at eye level and you have to Cable manage this desk tanatic away from the super clean aesthetic you can do so with either the ergon office Cable Management solution which makes it super simple or just DIY let's talk about the monitor I use this is the LG 34wn780 yes I know LG has some weird namings but one of the main selling points of this monitor is the Ergo stand gives complete control over your screen you can spin it almost 360 Degrees if you need to do that I've had many different monitors and configurations like a super ultra wide curved display full monitors and dual monitors with one vertical but I feel like sometimes it can be distracting for the most part the tasks I do require focus on just one or two things this monitor gets the job done for me then on top of the monitor I have the BenQ screen bar Halo which is a very popular accessory for a good reason and it's nice because it's USB powered so I just plug it into the rear of my monitor it illuminates your whole desk with no glare and without having to take up extra space like a traditional lamp the screen bar is adjusted wirelessly with this Sleek dial controller you can adjust the temperature and brightness or just set it to automatic also this provides by sliding to the back of your monitor which is known to reduce eye strain when your environment is dark then to the right of my monitor I have a Mac safe DOC The Stand one by Nomad in white and silver the stand one though kind of pricey is very high quality and heavy enough to hold against the strength of the Maxi magnet and perfect timing with iOS 17 you can rotate your phone while charging and get into standby mode which is a nice addition including a music player clocks calendars among many other handy widgets also sometimes when I'm coding on mobile responsive websites or mobile applications it's just nice to have a phone viewport there for you to test the interface underneath the ergonospice monitorizer I keep my 16 inch MacBook Pro it's nice to have a single cable setup on my computer so I can get straight to work after just one connection for that I use an Anker 71 USBC Hub which I adhere to the desk and it provides just what I need overall developing on a MacBook has been a great experience pretty much prefer a laptop compared to a desktop because of course you still get the option of taking the computer with you to built-in speakers on the monitor are honestly not the best however but I do have headphones on for a majority of the time when I'm on my main desk I have the airpods Max and space gray which provides an awesome Sound audio is essential for me to stay productive whether I'm listening to music listening to a podcast or even just enjoying some content other times since the airpod max are kind of heavy I just switch over to the airpods pro which is just as good for doing the aforementioned and with Apple's continuous play feature I don't have to manually switch between devices now let's look into some of the peripherals that are hooked to my computer but starting with this vegan leather desk mat by orbit key it's nice and Sleek looking and provides a storage location and as you may see I don't really have stationary things on my desk just haven't found a need for that lately I keep all of my notes on either notion or the Apple notes app I just find it easier that way to have everything on the cloud for a while I've been a fan of mechanical keyboards I've been loving my current build which is the envoy by more designs I ordered it with the polycarbonate chassis which gives it a cool retro look the aluminum plate and a silver mirror weight I'll be sure to list out the other details in the description as well mechanical keyboards are an interesting hobby because you're quite literally just making extra noise while typing but once you get your first mechanical keyboard you will appreciate the more mechanical and analog feel and I have two keycap sets that I switch around from time to time this gmk Dracula keycap set and I have this tomorrow themed keycap set by mode design I've gone from Luke 50 switches in my first build to tactile switches Now using linear switches and for sure I'm going to be sticking with the linear from now on by the way what's your typing speed I've been trying to improve it a little as well to get faster at coding things then I have the Logitech MX Master III and this is such a solid amount there's probably a reason why you see this mouse and so many people's setups you have just the extra buttons that you need like back and forth controls adjuster controls and a secondary scroll wheel I have tried the magic Trackpad to replace my mouse entirely but after a while it would give me some restraint I do see some people using the trackpad to their left or the keyboard to have quick access to swiping gestures so I'm going to be testing this out to see if it works for me let's talk a little bit about the chair I have the Herman Miller Aeron which is fully equipped and this is truly an essential piece since I do spend many hours sitting down mesh material is good to stay nice and cool and it's a fully adjustable from height tilt and even has these lumbar support pads and I've always wondered why these are many Hermann villagers don't have headrests after a quick search I learned that the ideal sitting position you should be able to move your head freely and you shouldn't have to rely on the headrest so that's an interesting note on chair ergonomics lastly let's look into some of the miscellaneous items these are not necessarily at my desk but they do complete my daily workflow starting with this Ikea pegboard I really just keep some things that I need quick access to like my keys and some remotes you can pretty much configure to suit your needs and beside that is the Govi RGB floor lamp which I can control from the remote or the gov app and most of the time I do keep it white during the day and at night sometimes I do like to add some color by the way this is how my setup looks in dark mode [Music] I did mention that with audio I use my headphones most of the time but other times where I just want to fill my entire space with sound I have this Sonos being 2 mounted to the wall which is more than enough for this pretty small apartment space but it packs awesome sound quality for music and watching movies and supports Dolby Atmos through the Sonos app for a nice mini theater like feel of course I had to stay both caffeinated and hydrated while I'm here from a coffee my current go-to method is pour over with this electric kettle and coffee grinder by fellow it gives you full control of the water temperature and coarseness of your grinds even though the pour over does take a little bit more time to get done it can be satisfying and leaves you with a very good tasting cup of coffee and I keep this nice looking bottle by Lark and granite white to match the area so that pretty much wraps it up I do want to do a little bit more with the negative spaces around my desk but without making it too overwhelming or too crowded either let me know if you have any recommendations or if you have any favorite desk tools that I can check out thanks for checking out my desk setup and I'll see you

8cZtbjI5FnQ,My NEW Ultimate Desk Setup &amp; Office Tour 2023!,UrAvgConsumer,2023-09-30 16:21:44,what's going on guys it's your average consumer and we finally got one of the rooms in the new studio setup and it's my office so come check it out [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here it is you guys this is my office this is where your boy is going to be handling most of his day-to-day work when it comes to the channel and anything else we do on social media this has been a long time coming this is I'm really proud of this place I think it looks dope but this is kind of the vibe that I've been going for for a long time now now of course we're going to talk about the tech different Furniture that's in here I'll have everything embedded in this video as well as linked down below but one thing I know you guys that's gonna stand out a lot is this wallpaper so I Gotta Give a huge shout out to my buddy Michael over on Instagram but he's the first place I saw this wallpaper so I got to give him his credit absolutely amazing looking wallpaper I feel like it really has that umph whenever anyone comes in they're like oh man that all looks sick now the wallpaper is dope but check it out guys I've got my 100 000 subscriber plaque as well as my 1 million subscriber plaque down below it shout out to you guys you guys are amazing uh so I had to throw that up there makes me feel like you know those producers who have like their platinum records on their walls this is it for me back when the plaques were super cool looking now you know you know no offense to those who have like the newer ones but I feel like this was the way to go this is these look dope now I spent plenty of hours behind a desk so I had to make sure I got one that looked really good and functionally was exactly what I wanted so I got to give a huge shout out to ergon office for hooking me up with their sway standing desk this thing's amazing so this desk absolutely fits the aesthetic that I was going for for a long time I've been using like that hack of a desk from Ikea it's like the kitchen countertop you've probably seen a ton of YouTubers talk about it and it's just absolutely beautiful you guys the wood is locally sourced out in Canada and hand crafted and Dom and I actually put this thing together really quickly including adding a few accessories to really get the most out of it so we've got this awesome shelf over here so we can house our monitors we've got some apple xdr displays so we've got two of them happy that it fits both uh but what's special is underneath it we also have some cable management so down here we have all of the cables uh for everything that you see here from our computer monitors speakers lights you got them all hooked up over here and you barely see any cables but I do like the cable management system that we've got over here it made it really simple to take all the different cables that we've got all back there line them up it makes it really easy because it has those holes you can just use velcro and strap everything in it's a very once you learn cable management and you get something like this you're not gonna have an ugly looking setup and if you want to just stand and work you can swipe up [Music] and as you can see it can get pretty high I'm exposing my height here so this thing is absolutely stunning it's the center piece of this room and I am super happy with it but like I said you guys this is an awesome desk and the accessories make for an easy and clean setup and of course if you guys want to get your hands on it I'll have the link to the exact one that I'm using and my accessories right below in the description but yeah that's our desk and we can kind of take a look at some of the tech on it uh the computer I'm using is the Mac Studio it fits perfectly under the Shelf uh you guys know me I'm a big Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals they're not sponsoring this but this right here is their MX mechanical keyboard This one is made for Max and I think you can also do Windows on this as well I love this one this one is the clicky version like for me personally that is so satisfying and I've got their uh yeah this is the MX Master III for Mac before Mac really doesn't even matter like that honestly but it is the one for the mac and I got the track pad here as well it's kind of round it all out I even have some of my old school accessories from like I don't know 2016 or so which has been a long time but and I got these like little charms on it from Japan I swear those two charms mean so much to me I feel like the channel blew up ever since I added them to my desk setup could be all in my head but I can't let them go like I give him a lot of credit and uh now you might notice something we've got a bit of a weird theme Here I know you see this Charizard Pokeball listen I'm a big Pokemon fan I'm not a big Charizard fan I think he's cool but for some reason we've got Charizard stuff like all over this room I don't know it I guess he just fits the aesthetic but yeah we've got like this whole Charizard thing going even the wallpaper kind of matches we've also got like these Walnut uh Kanto U2 speakers they're pretty small but they've been doing just fine so I can't complain too much so those are the speakers old school light bulb that I have over there now we've also got this Satoshi power station right here six ports it's a little excessive but I can charge any and all of the devices that I want right here on my desk so I'm happy about that uh we even have like I might have gone a little bit crazy with all the Walnut stuff well we even got this little headphone stand holding a pair of airpods Max and it's got a built-in wireless charger so you can go ahead and throw on any device that you want to wirelessly charge now also in terms of type we've got the webcam over here uh this is the insta 360 link now here we are I'm very happy with this it's got all of these different gestures that you can use to activate it so if I want to do my palm right now it's going to track me I can go to these guys over here you can see Jay it has really good quality it's 4K not mad at this at all this is my primary webcam when I'm on Zoom calls or I'm having any meetings this is what I'm using and it is a solid webcam I've got a little notepad you guys know my favorite mechanical pencil or the kuratoga pencils over here and drop my notes down keep track of what's going on in my brain now this desk also has a drawer nothing too special in here A bunch of random Gundam stuff some pins and cards portable charger this ridiculous cable that you guys saw me unbox in the massive Tech unboxing got my uh Jerry rig knives over here as well so nothing crazy in here things that I want quick access to I'll throw in this guy yeah no that is pretty it's been pretty nice I put like foreign this is what I did but yeah it has like a little shelf that you can move around put some like your most important things in here I'll pick it back up later and I've got like this Herman Miller chair that we've been using for years uh this is really comfortable and underneath it listen it it may seem a little bougie to have uh you know a little foot stool under your desk but listen once you get used to kicking your feet up at your death there's no going back there's just no going back at all it is super comfortable to be able to just kick your feet up and do whatever you need to like this is the life now next to our desk we've got this trash can as you can see it's a smart trash can that detects your hand so if you're ready throw something away the little pop open you throw something in there and you can just press this little button I'm not going to do it right now but once it's filled up you can press this button and then you can take your trash and then it'll basically vacuum seal the bag heat up a blade and cut it and it's raised to be disposed of it drops down and it sets the new bag up it's super cool so I had to bring it into this office as well love this thing okay so we spent a lot of time talking about the desk because I basically live here when I'm in the room but we got some other stuff in here as well so shout out to the Gundam poster you know the OG over there over here right next to it we've got the Dyson solar cycle this floor lamp is it's dope looking you know it's got this cool amber color you can change the temperature to be much brighter and wider if you want I like it warm so it can match the rest of the office it's got a USB port at the bottom so if you want to sit on your couch and charge something you can and let's say you're just like you know reading a book at night in the dark you can kind of pop this over use the lamp it's like really flexible you can kind of angle it wherever you want we do have a TV over here if you know if I've got a little down time I want to get a quick Apex session in I can chill on the couch get a game in you know that hasn't happened yet but who knows right now what's pretty cool is that with this Mount I can you know kind of turn it towards the couch if I want to and we've got the Sonos beam sound bar hooked up to it at the bottom now they kind they came out with this like sanus I think funny Sonos and sanus uh Thanos came out with this mount for the beam where you can put it on an existing TV mount so if you have the Sonos beam I think they have a couple of other sound bars that they support again look at this as an option especially considering this is like a swivel Mount if you want to angle it in certain ways uh you know the sound bar is going to be firing towards you I think this is pretty cool and of course below it we've got our PS5 Xbox series X Charizard skateboard not a skateboarder but it's there it looks dope though it's gonna be great for some b-roll shots and over here we've got like this you know little shelf that we've had for a couple years now we got a couple figures up here again the Charizard we've also got like my final fantasy 16 collector's edition figure I love this thing I'm a huge fan of that game I like it I don't know some people don't but it's my jam and I've got a couple other things like this cool little clock here if I want to put myself on a timer sometimes it's nice to just know times of ticking get whatever you're trying to get done before it goes off because once it goes off and you hear the once you hear that wrap it up but we got the homepod we actually have another one over here as well uh got the black one so we've got like a little bit of a somewhat a stereo effect it's like front and back it's kind of weird but you know they have the ability to understand their position you know alter the sound so that it fits the room well say what you want about the home pods they sound really good so Siri homepod speaker quality I like the expression yeah we've got some cool stuff from YouTube uh they sent at the end of the year some of the most impactful videos and stats about the channel so I had to keep that here uh it's actually really special and it matches the theme so I'm really happy about that uh over here we've got another Gundam poster uh we've got this really cool light switch this is from brilliant home and over here it's got like a screen obviously this is the most teched out light switch you'll ever see in your life obviously it can control the lights by swiping you can swipe up to turn on the lights you can dim it just a little bit by swiping partially uh but it also has or Google built in depending on what you're going for with Alexa and Google built into it I can give voice commands for just our standard lights above us so these aren't smart lights or anything but I can just say turn off office light and it'll kill the lights it even has a built-in camera so if you ever want to check in on the room make sure everything is okay you can always hop in also has a physical cover for it if you want to have privacy you can use it as an intercom if you have multiple in the house absolutely insane stuff like I said the most teched out smart home switch you'll find and I've also got like a little fan over here this thing is the Dyson hot and cool now this room for some reason is just always really warm no matter what the temperature is so if I need to keep it cool I can just turn on the cool air for whatever reason I get cold and these guys aren't I can turn on some heat as well now we've also got it on this pretty interesting like side table that I just threw under it but this guy is also like a Bluetooth speaker and I think it has like RGB Lights under it as well it does all kinds of stuff I think it also has like a wireless charger built right into it for now I'm gonna end this thing sit on top of it so that's a lot of like the Tech and stuff that we have over on this side of the room now over here is where I'll be storing a lot of stuff this is the closet for the office but we've got a lot of keyboards some controllers and I think like a ton of like smartphones from over the years this is like not even all of them this is gonna make more sense down the line I gotta actually organize all the stuff that we've got in here but yeah no clothes in my closet just a bunch of uh Tech all right this is that's been it right Judd's office the your average consumer office uh hopefully you guys like it tell me what you think of the style and I hope that this has helped with some inspiration for you guys get some little ideas and hints about things that you can do in your own space but that about wraps it up hopefully you enjoyed it if you want to see what we do with some of the other rooms in the studio let me know with a thumbs up and a comment down below we still got the streamer room that we're going to be working on this cool entertainment room there's a lot of stuff to work on in here The Gamers Paradise so if you're not subscribed to the channel make sure that you are because we're gonna have a ton of cool things to check out in this studio but until the next one guys your average consumer I'll catch you in the next one peace ah I am happy with

SjcvBFfMulY,My Productivity Desk Setup (2023),Ali Abdaal,2023-09-19 13:00:32,foreign [Music] [Music] welcome back to the channel and to my annual productivity desk setup walkthrough so in this video as usual I'm going to break down everything that's on my main productivity desk but also everything that's on my secondary gaming desk so let's get started with the desks themselves what desk is this I actually have no idea and this is actually the charcoal standing desk they very kindly sent it to me about two years ago and I've been using it ever since and they claim to be the world's best stunning desk honestly wouldn't say it's the world's best standing desk most standing desks are pretty similar I've used humming metal ones in the past I've used fully Jarvis ones in the past and all standing desks basically do exactly the same thing so there's nothing particularly special about this one but I do like the softness of the finish of the table and I do like the fact that the edges are very nice and curved and it has a nice little Gizmo for like raising or lowering the desk and then the chair that I'm using here is the Hermann Miller sale I have tried basically every chair in the Herman Miller collection they're all amazing but the Herman Miller sale is by far my favorite especially because of the blue and white configuration that I've got for this one and I've had this again for the last several years and I haven't felt the need to change it particularly even though I've tried tons and tons of chairs that this is my personal favorite now in terms of the hardware powering the setup the computer I'm using is the 2023 Apple M2 Pro Mac Mini and I've gone for the 32 gigabytes of RAM and I think it's a four terabyte hard drive now when you look at the desk the Mac Mini is nice and hidden because it's actually tucked into this little shelving unit and this is The Gather 2.0 from a company called Ugg monk again I've been using their products for the last several years and in my previous desk setup in Cambridge I was using the calendar 1.0 but then they very kindly sent me the gather 2.0 to test out and I've been using it on my desk for the last 12 months or so and this is super nice because it means I've got a nice little shelf for the Mac Mini to go into and then I've also got the raised stand for the Monitor and for extra accessories and it's a very nice way of organizing a desk which means I don't need an extra monitor arm either on the desk there's a few other accessories as part of the augment can gather 2.0 set so we've got these two little boxes on top of the monitor stand thing and this is where I store errant SD cards and also or as to a Post-It notes because I quite like Post-it notes I like to remind myself of things and shove them on the computer screen and over on the side of my desk I've got a wireless phone charger and I can attach my phone to it and charge my phone wirelessly the main monitor that I use is the Mac Studio display and then off to the side I've got the LG dual up monitor which I often have in a vertical configuration now these days mostly when it comes to productivity I'm a one monitor kind of guy I used to be an ultra wide kind of guy I used to have this enormous monstrosity of a 49 inch Ultra wide Monitor and I used to feel really good about the fact that I could have Windows here and there and there but increasingly what I've realized is that at least for me when it comes to personal productivity most of the stuff I do requires focused work looking at one thing rather than trying to multitask now one of the other key peripherals that's powering this entire desk setup is the Cal digit TS3 Thunderbolt Hub thingy and that plugs into the Mac Mini but then the monitors plug into that and that's convenient because a it's got an SD card reader for footage like this and it also opens up more ports for me to be able to plug speakers and microphones and other funky gizmos into the speakers I'm using are these lovely white Kanto U2 speakers and they're on this speaker Riser arm thing which kind of puts them up at a little like 10 15 degree angle and again the main reason for these is because they are white and they look nice and they also sound really good but I'm not an audiophile I cannot tell the difference between different speakers but I read a bunch of reviews these ones looked amazing I bought them a few years ago and I haven't really looked back so if I'm ever taking a zoom call that needs privacy or if I've got people in the office and I need to concentrate I just put on these noise canceling headphones and I play Lord of the Rings soundtrack through them and it's really good and it just allows me to focus really nicely now in terms of peripherals I have two sources of navigation so I use the Logitech MX Master 3s Mouse for Mac which is a little bit discolored because I've been using it so much again I've been using the Logitech MX Master Series for absolutely years at one point I used an Apple Magic Mouse because I really wanted to have a white one before they made this in white although I really wish this was in white because it would go with the desk setup better but now they've made this in white it's so much more ergonomic than the Magic Mouse and I absolutely swear by it and then over on the other side of the keyboard I also have the Apple trackpad now again I like to be the kind of guy that has these two different things I've got the left hand on the track pad the right hand on the mouse and I'm basically just use the trackpad because it's got smoother scrolling and because I can use gestures to switch windows or maximize and minimize things stuff like that and in between The Mouse and the trackpad I actually have a custom keyboard from a company called the light mode which is actually my company this is a sample of a keyboard that we've got that we're just getting from various factories and stuff basically me and my team are trying to build the best accessories for productivity and we're trying to figure out how to build a really good keyboard and so some of these keys are from the factories I think some of these keys are from the Newfie keyboard which I also like so essentially we just bought a load of keyboards and we're sort of disassembling them to try and figure out what are the things that I personally and my team really like about certain kinds of keyboards and then how can we sort of combine these to create the ultimate mechanical keyboard we're not quite there yet but we just keep on testing new keyboards so this is particularly exciting now I often alternate between a mechanical keyboard and also the Apple magic keyboard these days I've been on the mechanical keyboard hype because I'm trying to build one and also because typing on a mechanical keyboard just feels a little bit nicer than typing on an apple magic keyboard although I do type marginally faster on an Apple magic keyboard so sometimes I do swap it out depending on what I need to do I've got this little Harry Potter little bobbing head thing which was a gift from one of our video editors I also like to keep a blue hourglass on my desk this is an anti-procrastination mechanism because essentially if I'm struggling with procrastination from something I would just say you know what I'm just going to do it for five minutes and then I will turn over The Hourglass and then as the time is going I'll just make a start on the thing and I'll genuinely convince my brain that I'm only going to do it for five minutes but then usually once I've been doing it for five minutes I kind of forget that The Hourglass is going and then I'm in the flow and then I'm doing the thing because really the thing with procrastination is that fundamentally it's mostly a problem with getting started getting started is the hardest part once you've gotten started whether by using a timer or an hourglass or whipping yourself or doing whatever you want it just becomes way easier to keep going a few other funky things on this desk so I actually have on the desk a low profile microphone arm this is from Elgato and these are also the microphone arms that we use when I record my podcast and on top of this I've got the Elgato Wave 3 microphone again I like this because it's white and I like the sort of white and blue aesthetic but this is nice because it's connected with a very long USB cable over to the mac and what this means is that if I'm on a zoom call or for example if I'm teaching the live session my part-time YouTuber Academy then I can bring this microphone in and I can actually use proper microphone quality while also speaking directly to the camera and so the first thing to mention is this camera which is the Sony fx3 which I've got sitting on a nice little tripod it's always at exactly the same height I've got it set up perfectly and on that we've got a cheap third-party 24 millimeter F 1.8 lens with an ND filter on it and this is absolutely perfect I really like 24 millimeters as a focal length because I basically the camera is arm's distance away and with this particular focal length hopefully it feels like I'm just at my desk and I'm talking to you which is exactly what this is whereas if the focal length was a little bit further away it sort of looks a bit presentery and I don't really like the presenter look which is why we've gone for 24 millimeters now when it comes to productivity one thing I often think about is productivity for the sake of what like what is the thing that we're actually trying to optimize for and so when I'm on this desk I'm often reading books and trying to learn new stuff and actually one of my favorite ways to learn new things is by using brilliant or very kindly sponsoring this video brilliant is the absolute best way to learn maths or data science or computer science in an engaging and interactive fashion they've got thousands of lessons across all these different topics organized into courses that you can take at your own pace and the really cool thing is that brilliant customizes the content that you see so that you can work at your own level now my personal favorite courses and brilliant are the computer science ones because back when I was applying to medical school I was torn between medicine and computer science and I ultimately decided to go for medicine in the end but there was always part of me that was like oh I really kind of wanted to learn more about computer science but through taking some of the courses on brilliant I've gotten more of an understanding about Python and about algorithms and about data structures and they've got a new course that they've released recently called thinking and code which is really nice because it helps you learn the principles of coding but applied in a real life fashion and one of the things I always swear by is anyone wanting to start a business or make money on the internet anything like that learning to code is an incredibly useful skill that lets you see what problems are out there in the world and lets you just appreciate how you might be able to use code to solve those problems you also might have heard the phrase that data is the new oil and people who have data analysis skills are really getting ahead in the workplace and also in business and so you can check out brilliant data analysis fundamentals course to brush up on the basics in a really interactive way when you sign up you can take a quick quiz that matches the content based on your interest and your skill level and it works whether you're a complete beginner or whether you're a pro ready to write right programs for a quantum computer so if any of that sounds up your street then head over

use that link will also get 20 off the brilliant annual premium subscription so thank you so much brilliant for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it now connected to the camera we also have an audio input and that audio input is from a microphone which is directly above me which you cannot see right now but I'm going to show you the behind the scenes look and this is the Sennheiser mk416 microphone which is connected via an XLR cable over to the Sony fx3 and this means that I can just hit record on this camera we already have the microphone at the perfect height it's already out of shot and so hopefully the audio of this video sounds pretty reasonable but I haven't really had to do anything special back in the day I had to record audio separately put it into a zoom H6 sync and synchronize in post now it all just goes straight into the camera and it works pretty well and so part of the reason why this desk setup might seem a little Overkill is because I've just thrown the kitchen sink and just trying to reduce the friction as much as possible and that's a tip that I'll give for you as well figure out what are the things that you actually want to do when it comes to your productivity or other areas of your life and then try your best to find the tech the tools and the systems that will reduce the friction to make it as easy as possible to do the thing so speaking of easy as possible to do the thing we also on this desk have an enormous light this is the aperture 120d with the aperture light Dome 2 attached to it and again this is a light that I've had for many many years it's been absolutely trusty it's never broken it's never let me down and that is attached to a c-stand and it's got this little remote with it so I can turn the light off and I can turn it back on again and I can turn it off and back on again and it's just kind of fun now to add even more Overkill Vibes to our YouTube setup connect it to the c-stand I actually have one of those magic friction arm things and that is connected to an extra camera and that camera is mounted vertically and that's our YouTube shorts filming camera and again the fact that this camera is there and it's set up and it's attached to a 50 millimeter lens and it's always there means that whenever I want to film YouTube shorts It's solo friction all I have to do is unplug this microphone plug it into that camera and then I can bang out a bunch of YouTube shorts in a single filming session so we've got camera number one we've got camera number two which is the shorts camera but then we also have above me camera number three which is the overhead rig so if you've been following this channel for any length of time you might have seen that I like to use overhead shots where I'm drawing diagrams or like writing on a book or showing a book or showing a piece of tech and so we have mounted a third camera that's always permanently set up and that is attached to an extra c stand and so again this looks like a little bit of an eyesore if you come into the studio and you see this it looks a bit intense but it's all about reducing the friction to the things that I want to do I'm not trying to optimize for Aesthetics here I'm trying to optimize for functionality now the great thing is that all three of these cameras are firstly power by dummy batteries that are connected to the AC power adapters which means I never need to worry about switching batteries or anything like that but they're also all connected via HDMI to a little device called the atom mini pro and the attack mini pro is a device that's connected to my Mac which functions as a bit of a webcam and so the cool thing about this is that I can use the input from any of these three cameras and I can use that input as a webcam for my Mac I use this camera when I'm filming live sessions for my part-time YouTuber Academy this is when I have several hundred students on a zoom call people from all around the world and I'm talking for two hours about how to grow on YouTube but the fact that I can speak to this camera I've got my slides on the screen and people are just blown away by the quality of the webcam but the even cooler thing is that it's not just this camera I can use all I have to do is hit a button on the atom mini and then I can switch to the overhead camera boom it goes overhead I can grab a piece of paper and then I can kind of draw whatever I want and so whenever I do these live sessions it's a bit of an orchestration of like speaking to this camera controlling the slides hitting the buttons on the atom mini switching the camera angles drawing diagrams and hopefully it makes for a very nice immersive experience and it allows our students to feel as if they're going getting like so much value from the session because from the diagrams and showing the Frameworks and everything that goes into growing this YouTube channel now the only other thing to mention about this desk before we move on to desk number two is the fact that I have various fake plants and real plants as Greenery around me firstly I've got this Ikea fetch cup potted plant which is an absolute staple of every Tech YouTuber's desk and I've actually had one of these plants on my desk since 2014 since I was in my like third year of medical school and I just had it on my desk ever since and then around me I've also got a bunch of fake plants and I've also got a bunch of real plants as well but I have read some studies that shows that having Greenery and nature even if it's fake nature around you helps reduce your stress levels and increase your creativity and your focus and so I thought why not give it a go and then the final thing I have on my desk at all times is a mock-up of my brand new book feel good productivity how to do more of what matters to you so if you're interested in potentially being more productive in a way that's enjoyable and meaningful and sustainable you might like to check out my new book feelgoodproductivity.com or you can check out the link in the video description so this is desk number one but probably what makes this the most productive desk setup I've ever had is that actually part of this desk setup we've also got a second standing desk and so that is a standing desk Hermann Miller and on this standing desk I actually have a gaming PC from Alienware this was an absolute like dream purchase of mine ever since I was like 12 years old I would salivate over alienware.com and like oh my god build all these PCS and realize I could never afford it and then when this YouTube channel and this business started doing well I thought you know what I'm going to treat myself to a gaming PC and I can convince myself I'm being productive because it's also quite good for editing and Premiere Pro and things like that not gonna lie the Alienware gaming PC is a little bit big on the desk but it's really nice and it's connected to the doe Spectrum one 4k monitor which they very kindly sent me about a year ago and it's great it's 4K resolution it's 144 Hertz it's USBC and also DisplayPort and it's also got a KVM switch built into it which means I can connect a laptop and my gaming PC and also my PS5 to the same Monitor and I can just switch it with a single press of a button and the gaming PC is connected to the Alienware keyboard and also the Alienware Mouse which are nice because they are white and blue and white and blue is my aesthetic and then off to the side I've got the PlayStation 5. I don't really play the PS5 very much it's mostly the gaming PC if I want to do gaming and the games that I particularly enjoy are Diablo 4 these days but also played a lot of Hogwarts Legacy and back when dragonfly to the World of Warcraft expansion came out that was playing quite a lot of that on this gaming PC as well but the coolest thing about the second desk setup is that underneath the standing desk I actually have a walking pad walking treadmill thing and that has been one of the purchases that's most transformed my I guess my health somewhat my productivity over the last six months I think I got it about six seven months ago in the last six months I've used the device a total of 141 times and I've accumulated 3767 minutes of exercise and I've walked a distance of 244 kilometers all while either gaming on the PC or while doing writing and other various Focus related tasks on the PC and this is great stuff because like you know as someone who sits at a desk and mostly has a desk job I.E writing and filming and learning stuff in front of a screen it's actually been really hard for me to get my 10 000 steps in every day but there's so much evidence that getting more steps in each day is better for your health better for your longevity it's better for reducing fat and so then after watching a bunch of reviews I decided to bite the bullet and get this walking pad portable full foldable treadmill thing that I've had under my desk for the last six months and actually after filming this video I've got 90 minutes worth of Zoom calls but I'm going to take those Zoom calls on the Walking desk so check this out 1 hour 26 minutes 8 267 steps so this was one hour of Zoom call with Angus one hour on a zoom call with Dan who's my online personal trainer like health coach and now I need to watch a bunch of Team updates that the team have sent and so I'm going to continue doing that on the treadmill so that I'm hoping to get to 10 000 steps literally in this last two hours of just being on the treadmill it's great everyone should get a treadmill is so so so good for getting in the steps and the other really cool thing about having the walking treadmill is that when I'm gaming which is kind of a waste of time and I do feel a bit guilty about it I just turn the walking pad on and that means that while I'm gaming I'm also getting my steps in and that kind of turns gaming into a more productive activity and also more healthy activity I'm not saying that every single thing in your life has to be productive what I am saying is that for me health and fitness and Longevity is important and I do want to get in my 10 000 steps a day and so if I can do that while also playing a video game I'm winning across all fronts I'm getting the Best of Both Worlds I'm taking care of my health while also adding joy to my life because I enjoy playing video games the other cool thing that I didn't quite realize when I first got the setup is that that desk is not just for gaming it's also if I need a sort of change of scenery now change of sceneries are just generally nice to have like going from a desk to a coffee shop to a living room whatever that might be but actually going from one desk to another desk and changing from sitting to standing and even changing from Mac to Windows all of that is just a surprisingly helpful change in state and so this is now something that I kind of want to have in all future houses that I have provided the room that I'm in is big enough being able to have two different desks for two different modes that's just so cool now if you enjoyed this video and you're interested in more ways that I use Tech in my daily life to be more productive in a way that's intentional and effective and meaningful and enjoyable and stuff you might like to check out this video over here in which I go through a day in the life and I talk through exactly what apps and what tech I'm using throughout the day to try and maximize my productivity so thank you so much for watching have a great day and I'll see in the next video bye,"{""computer"": ""2023 Apple M2 Pro Mac Mini"", ""mouse"": ""Logitech MX
